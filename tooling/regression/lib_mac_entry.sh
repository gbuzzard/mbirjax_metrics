#!/usr/bin/env bash
# lib_mac_entry.sh — the macOS launchd ENTRYPOINT clone, shared by enable_nightly.sh and
# enable_torch_nightly.sh.  macOS only; the cluster path never reaches this file.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS.  macOS TCC protects ~/Documents (and ~/Desktop, ~/Downloads).  A launchd
# agent runs as a bare /bin/bash holding no Full Disk Access, so it cannot even READ a wrapper
# stored under a protected folder.  The run dies before its first line with
#
#     /bin/bash: .../tooling/regression/run_regression.sh: Operation not permitted
#
# and exit 126.  That is a SILENT schedule failure: `launchctl list` still shows the agent,
# `status_nightly.sh` still reports the schedule installed, and only the launchd err log says
# otherwise.  Diagnosed 2026-08-08, after it had cost the jax CPU series 51 consecutive nights
# — the tell was that every MANUAL run worked (Terminal has Full Disk Access) while no
# scheduled run ever did.
#
# THE FIX.  Give launchd an entrypoint OUTSIDE the protected tree: a small clone of the metrics
# repo whose only job is to be executed by the agent.  Phase 1 of each wrapper then updates its
# own $WORK_DIR/metrics clone and re-execs THAT, exactly as before — so the entry clone supplies
# only the ~46 lines of phase 1, and the measured code still comes from origin every night.
#
# WHY NOT POINT THE AGENT AT $WORK_DIR/metrics.  Phase 1 updates that clone and then re-execs
# it.  bash reads a script incrementally rather than all at once, so a script that rewrites
# itself mid-run is a real hazard.  The cluster keeps its standing checkout separate for the
# same reason (nightly_plan.md §6).
#
# WHY ONE CLONE PER NIGHTLY.  They are read-only during a run, so sharing would work, but a
# refresh (`reset --hard`) rewrites files in place.  Separate clones mean enabling the torch
# nightly cannot perturb the jax entrypoint even if the jax agent happens to be running — the
# standing rule that the jax nightly must not break, applied to the install step.
#
# Requires: METRICS_URL (from the caller's regression.env / torch_regression.env).
# Provides:  reg_entry_clone <dir>   ensure <dir> is a current shallow clone of METRICS_URL.
