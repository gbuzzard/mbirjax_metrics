# Run ONE mbirtorch nightly regression pass right now, by hand.
#
# Sibling of run_one_night.sh (the jax pass).  Forwards to the real torch harness,
# `tooling/regression/run_torch_regression.sh` — the exact code the scheduler will run — so this is
# a faithful single pass: for each tracked mbirtorch branch whose remote tip moved since it was
# last measured, it clones the tip, runs the suite + the torch writer, writes results into the
# harness's persistent metrics clone, and pushes to GitHub.
#
# The harness manages its own conda env (CONDA_ENV in torch_regression.env, default
# `mbirtorch_regression`, auto-created).  Trial knobs pass straight through the environment:
# REG_TORCH_SMOKE=1 (fast 1-cell plumbing check), REG_TORCH_NO_PUSH=1 (write locally, push
# nothing), REG_TORCH_FORCE=1 (re-measure an unmoved tip).
#
# On a SLURM cluster, add --sbatch to SUBMIT this pass as a batch job on a GPU node (resources
# from torch_run_configs.env's TORCH_SLURM_* knobs) instead of running it in this session.
#
# Exit-code meaning (faithful to the scheduler): 0 = clean; 1 = a hard-gate REGRESSION was
# detected (an ALERT, not a script failure); >=2 = the harness itself failed.
